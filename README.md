## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a single, mundane object in the house (like the chipped blue plate) that holds a suppressed family history. Show, don't tell, the colonial relationship embedded in its journey.
- Compose a dialogue between Ada and Iris where a 'gift' (like the coconut) is exchanged. Let the subtext reveal the complex power dynamics of hospitality, obligation, and historical debt.
- Write a monologue from the perspective of the land itself, describing the house's decay and Ada's arrival not as events, but as sensations, pressures, and slow reclamations.
- Create a 'found document'—a page from a diary, a solicitor's letter, a plant press—that Ada discovers. Let its language (formal, personal, bureaucratic) contradict the official history of the place.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Palimpsest Map' interactive layer: a digital map of the house and grounds where users can toggle between eras (pre-colonial ecology, plantation layout, post-colonial decay, Ada's present) to visualize the layers of occupation and erasure.
- Develop a 'Minimalist Dialogue Generator' tool that strips dialogue of exposition, forcing the writer to convey colonial tension and feminist resistance through subtext, silence, and the weight of what is left unsaid.
